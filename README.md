- About product cycle, regular updates such as software releases for Google and Microsoft or product launches for Apple, suggest a robust product cycle aimed at keeping the market engaged.
- Stakeholders should align marketing and sales strategies to capitalize on increased consumer attention during new product launches.
- They should also monitor competitors' launch dates to strategically schedule their own product releases or updates to maximize market impact and avoid overlapping with major industry events.

- The tech sector shows significant dominance in all three metrics, reflecting its significant impact on the market.
- Comparing revenue and profit, there is a notable difference in the scale of revenue versus profit, which could be as a result of operational and margin efficiencies.
- Investors might consider diversifying their portfolios by investing in companies like Tesla that show potential for growth despite lower current metrics.

**What is the frequency distribution of daily price changes for Tesla (TSLA)?**

- This graph looks simple, but it say a lot...!
- If most daily changes cluster around 0%, it indicates moderate stability despite high volatility, with the stock often returning close to its opening price by the close.
- Wide spreads in daily price changes highlight high volatility, and if bars extend significantly to the left and right of 0%, it shows frequent substantial gains and losses over the days, indicating that potential higher risk and reward scenarios.
- My advise to stakeholders are that:
- (i) Investors should consider the observed spread and skewness in daily price changes when assessing the risk associated with Tesla stock.
- (ii) High volatility evidenced by wide spreads and frequent extreme changes might suit risk-tolerant investors looking for significant gains, although with corresponding risks.
- (iii) Depending on the skewness of the data, investors might adjust their strategies. For example, a positive skew could encourage strategies that capitalize on growth trends, while a negative skew might warrant protective measures like stop-loss orders to manage potential losses.
- (iv) For Tesla‚Äôs management, understanding stock volatility could inform decisions about timing capital raises or stock-based compensation, aligning these activities with periods of relative stock price stability to maximize outcomes.

- The Pareto principle, often referred to as the 80/20 rule, seems to apply here where approximately 80% of the price swing impact is caused by about 20% of the factors ('Earnings Reports' and 'Economic News'). 
- The cumulative percentage line shows a rapid initial climb, emphasizing how a few key factors can dominate the impact on stock prices.
- Investors and analysts should closely monitor earnings reports and significant economic news, as these factors have the highest likelihood of affecting stock prices.
- Understanding which factors have the most significant impact can help in crafting strategies to mitigate risk, particularly around times when impactful news is expected.

- Electronics in North America is the dominant revenue segment, it contributes $50 billion; this highlights the significance of electronic products in Amazon's largest market.
- North America leads in every product category. It shows its role as Amazon's primary revenue driver. For example, it accounts for:
   - 63 % of total electronics sales.
   - 60 % of total book sales.
   - 59 % of total clothing sales.
- Comparative analysis reveals Europe and Asia are more modest in contributions, with European electronics sales at  $30B and Asian electronic sales ùëéùë° $20B.
- Electronics consistently generate the most revenue across all regions, indicating their global demand and market penetration.
- There is a clear step-down in revenue from electronics to books and then clothing within each region, indicating a prioritized market focus.
- For stakeholders, given the high revenue from electronics, especially in North America, they might consider investing further in this category to maximize profitability.
- There may be opportunities to expand book and clothing sales in Europe and Asia, considering their lower relative sales figures compared to North America.
- Considering diversifying more intensely into other regions with tailored product strategies could balance the revenue streams and reduce dependency on the North American electronics market.
